# Advanced Topics in Human Neuroimaging: Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) Analysis

This project contains MATLAB scripts and data for the Week 6 assignment of the Advanced Topics in Human Neuroimaging course. The focus of this project is to calculate different types of Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) and explore their relationships with behavior.

## Project Structure

- `/scripts`: Contains all MATLAB scripts used for data analysis and visualization.
- `/data`: Includes inputs and outputs MATLAB `.mat` file and a graph for Dynamic ISC.
